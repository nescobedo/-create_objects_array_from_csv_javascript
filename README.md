# create_objects_from_csv

My solution to creating an array of objects from CSV table/text data.

It's also a working Node.js environment utilizing Gulp 4, Browsersync, Bootstrap 4, Babel, Sass, css/js minification, and sourcemaps.

## How to get started?

1. Clone this repo
2. yarn or npm install to install the required dependencies
3. gulp to kickoff the dev server, it will open your browser window with the project running.
4. Edit html files in /public or any sass or js files in /src. Browser-sync will reload after any changes.
