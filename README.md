# create_objects_from_csv

My solution to creating an array of objects from CSV table/text data.

Also a working gulp4 repo utilizing Browser-sync, Bootstrap 4 and Babel (es2015)

## How to get started?

<ol>

1. Clone this repo
2. yarn or npm install to install the required dependencies
3. gulp to kickoff the dev server, and open your browser window.
4. Edit html files in /public, and sass files in /src/sass or any js files in /src/js. Browser-sync will reload after any changes.
